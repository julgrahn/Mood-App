# Mood-App
A multiplatform app for Android, IOS*, Mac, Windows. Uses a login form and then interacts with the user trying to improve their mood.

App which uses a login form where user can signup and credentials will save in a json-file locally.
Then the user can get a quote depending on their mood.
User can logout.
This is now working without any issues on android. 
I deployed the APK using ubuntu on a virtual machine using Buildozer which has support for Kivy

*IOS not working since I don't have access to a MAC
